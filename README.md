_A quick-start HTML5 template with Tailwind + Alpine included_

## Getting started

Download the [source code .zip](https://github.com/agonzalezio/tailpine/archive/main.zip) and extract it into your project's folder or clone this project `git clone https://github.com/agonzalezio/tailpine`; you can also [use this template](https://github.com/agonzalezio/tailpine/generate) to create a repo on your GitHub.

## Usage

You can use this template without installing any dependency or running commands. Just edit the html files located in the `public/` directory.

Alternatively you can use **parcel-bundler** to edit and compile a production ready bundle with source minification and CSS purging.

1. Clone and install required dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Run `npm start` to create a development server with parcel and navigate to _localhost/index.html_ to view your site.
3. Create and edit as many HTML files as you need and make sure to link them to the css/libs/tailwind.css and js/vendor/alpine.js files.
4. Run `npm run build` to create a production bundle.
5. Upload the generated `dist/` folder to your hosting provider.
